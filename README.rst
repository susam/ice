Ice - WSGI on the rocks
=======================
Ice is a Python module with a WSGI microframework meant for developing
small web applications in Python. It is a single file Python module
inspired by `Bottle`_.

Why Ice?
--------
This microframework was born as a result of experimenting with WSGI
framework. Since what started as a small experiment turned out to be
several hundred lines of code, it made sense to share the source code on
the web, just in case anyone else benefits from it.

This microframework has a very limited set of features currently. It may
be used to develop small web applications. For large web applications,
it may make more sense to use a more wholesome framework such as
`Flask`_ or `Django`_.

It is possible that you may find that this framework is missing a useful
API that another major framework provides. In such a case, you have
direct access to the WSGI internals to do what you want via the
documented `API`_.

If you believe that a missing feature or a bug fix would be useful to
others, you may `report an issue`_, or even better, fork this `project
on GitHub`_, develop the missing feature or the bug fix, and send a
patch or a pull request. In fact, you are very welcome to do so, and
turn this experimental project into a matured one by contributing your
code and expertise.
